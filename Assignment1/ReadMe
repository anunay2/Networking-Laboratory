This is the README file for the dataLinkLayer application.

What is it? It is a simple talk application developed for DOS operating system. This doesn't use any existing protocols like TCP/IP and simulates data-link layer activity. It simply exchanges packets with the computer with the mentioned MAC address with the help of the packet driver. Why DOS you ask :P ?

    DOS doesn't come with networking support built-in. So you need to go into the basics and develop the application with bare minimum. In this case , just on top of the packet driver. So you really get to learn the basics!
    This also happened to be one of our Networking lab assignments.

Prerequisites

    Packet driver for your NIC for DOS. Find the one you need here: http://www.georgpotthast.de/sioux/packet.htm

How to build and run?

Change the destination MAC ID by editing this line in dostalk_dataLinkLayer.c to give the correct destination MAC ID:

unsigned char dest_mac[] = "\x08\x00\x27\xe4\xee\xd6"; 

Compile dataLinkLayer.c on DOS with the compiler mode set to huge.

Repeat the above steps on the other computer.

Run dataLinkLayer.exe on both the machines.
